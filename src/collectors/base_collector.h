//! Abstract base class for a collector that contains a chain in Protobuf form

//! This is an abstract base class for a structure called data collector, or
//! collector for short. A collector is meant to store the state of a Markov
//! chain at all iterations, composed of the allocations and the unique values
//! vectors. These values are stored in classes built via the Google Protocol
//! Buffers library, also known as Protobuf. In particular, at the end of each
//! iteration of a BNP algorithm of this library, its state is saved to the
//! collector. This means that the collector will contain the states of the
//! whole Markov chain by the end of the running of the algorithm.

  //! Current size of the chain
