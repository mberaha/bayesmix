//! Class for a "virtual" collector which contains all objects of the chain

//! This is a type of collector which includes a deque containing all states of
//! the chain. Unlike the file collector, this is a purely "virtual" collector,
//! in the sense that it does not write chain states anywhere and all
//! information contained in it is destroyed when the main that created it is
//! terminated. It is therefore useful in situation in which writing to a file
//! is not needed, for instance in a main program that both runes and algorithm
//! and computes the estimates.
